              "648  i had an old sonicare ( rechargable ) for about a year and a half . i dropped it and it stopped working . ( my fault . ) not willing to pay ~$[...] for another rechargable one , i thought i would give the e3000 a try . i then bought my first e3000 in august for 2006. it mysteriously stopped working around december of 2006. ( i did n't drop it this time . ) i bought a second one . it also mysteriously stopped working in march of 2007. ( again , i did n't drop it or harm the toothbrush in any way ! ) 2 dead toothbrushes in 8 months ! i 'm not sure if i should buy another e3000 or if i should give up on the sonicare brand completely .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

              "172  spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health ; eat nothing but mcdonald 's fast food for 30 days . the result ; his health gets ruined . while spurlock 's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet , it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health . i rarely eat mcdonalds ( though i enjoy the odd coke ) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia , as it is worldwide . the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer . mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food , and made ray kroc ( its founder ) a fortune . i do n't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil , because they are multinational corporations ; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers , as well as shareholders . we happily buy coke , mcdonalds , cigarettes , and many other things obviously bad for our health , and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad . in our individualistic culture , we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control , and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists . however , the rocketing levels of obesity , especially amoung children , are of great concern , and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical . we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction , otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents . spurlock 's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously , and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

              "454  i measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with la crosse charger , which i also bought from amazon . the capacity ranged from 547 mah to 2002 mah , with the average being 886 mah . that 's about a third of the stated capacity . before i took the measurements , i made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of aa nimh batteries : la crosse and energizer . both scored very close to their stated capacity . therefore , the test is valid and sunpak 's claim of 2650 mah is grossly overstated . my advice : avoid sunpak like the plague !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

              "121  without a doubt , the highlight is the dvd of the 1975 show in london . \" born to run , \" the album , had put him on the cover of \" time \" and \" newsweek \" the same week in october , 1975 , one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story . the publicity and hype generated by columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash : \" nobody can be that good . \" so here we see his first show ever in the uk , playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics , people thinking , \" hey , ' rock and roll future , ' this is the land of the beatles , the rolling stones , the who - who do you think you 're kidding . no unknown kid from america deserves ' time ' and ' newsweek . ' \" the show begins in almost total darkness , a piano softly plays , then harmonica , and a soft spotlight lights the kid from new jersey who sings \" thunder road , \" accompanied by only piano . an unknown song at the time , \" thunder road \" has become a springsteen classic . imho , especially given the expectations , it is a perfect understated opening . the dvd has the entire show , including everything from the hard rock of \" she 's the one , \" and \" born to run , \" the song , to a much slowed down version of \" for you , \" an underated sleeper on his first album , \" greeting from asbuty park , nj . \" bruce accompanies himself on the piano and i swear , this version of \" for you \" is so beautiful it could be the scruffy new jersey kid channeling god . any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking springsteen was merely hype has no ears , no taste , or was xenophobic . the show gives more than a big hint that this springsteen guy is for real , as a songwriter and performer , and that \" born to run , \" especially , is an extraodinary album . there are only eight songs , but none are fill . repeated listenings of the four corners of the album ( before cds ) \" backstreets , \" \" jungleland , \" thunder road , \" and the title song are so good they become.. . well , addictive , works of genius , and lead to still more listening . \" tenth avenue freeze out , \" \" night , \" and especially \" she 's the one \" could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album . even the whispered \" meeting across the river , \" fits and helps the album become a coherent whole . the songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts . as a footnote i 'll offer the opinion that bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as \" born to run \" and that is his next one , \" darkness on the edge of town . \" everything he has released is good ; a good bit of it is great , but i do n't think anything else matches \" born to run \" or \" darkness . \" i do n't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released . the dvd of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock 's greatest performer . by 1985 he would be the biggest rock star in the world , selling out multiple nights at football stadiums . the remastered cd is nothing special to my ears . perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement . the dvd , \" the making of ' born to run , ' \" is interesting , but will probably appeal mainly to fans . however the dvd of the 1975 london show ought to appeal to anyone who likes bruce , or rock & roll , or showmanship , or history . its a treat   \n",

              "445  if you find imovie complicated , this product is not for you . if you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you . if you find that you would like more control of your video / audio than you find in imovie but do n't want to spend a lot of money , boy have you come to the right place . i take quite a lot of home video ( new baby and all ) and found that imovie would frustrate me when i could n't do some more advanced tasks . imovie is a great intro product . if you are new to video , use it until you find that you feel limited ( many will never will get to that point ) . when ( and if ) you find that you feel some constraints in imovie , then move up to fce . a note for most , imovie and fce typically are not for dvd / hard drive camcorders . they do n't have the output necessary to directly connect . you may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the dvd / hd to content that is usuable in these products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

              "522  when the preview aired , i was pushing the movie to all my friends , based on the hilarity of the preview . at that time , i skeptically said , \" i hope these do n't turn out to be the only funny parts . \" and that was exactly what happened . the rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes , crass humor that went way over the line and kept running . the pee joke was funny once , but even at that one time they overdid it , then overdid it again , and then again . the harry potter parts were hilarious ! jack sparrow was awesome ! but i wished i had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie . it 's another scary movie ( 1 ) deal , only worse ! i love the newest scary movies , they are funny , but 1 really sucked . it was funny now and then , but a lot of it was stupid . so is epic movie , only worse . do n't waste your money buying it . rent and fast forward .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
